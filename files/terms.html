        <p><strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong></p>

        <p>
          These terms and conditions apply to the PisTorque app (hereby referred
          to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Sertan
          Akkuş (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported
          service.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          By downloading or using the Application, you agree to the following
          terms. It is strongly recommended that you carefully read and
          understand these terms before using the Application.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, extraction of
          its source code, translation, or creation of derivative versions is
          strictly prohibited. All intellectual property rights remain the
          property of the Service Provider.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          The Service Provider strives to ensure that the Application is
          efficient and functional. However, they reserve the right to modify
          the Application or charge for services at any time. Any such changes
          will be clearly communicated.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          The Application stores and processes personal data that you provide in
          order to deliver its services. You are responsible for the security of
          your device and access to the Application. The Service Provider
          advises against rooting or jailbreaking your device, as it may
          compromise security and prevent the Application from working properly.
        </p>

        <br />
        <strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
        <p>
          The Application uses third-party services that have their own Terms &
          Conditions. Below are links to those services:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank"
              >Google Play Services</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank"
              >AdMob</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank"
              >Google Analytics for Firebase</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics"
              target="_blank"
              >Firebase Crashlytics</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <p>
          Some functions of the Application require an active internet
          connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data). The Service Provider is not
          responsible if the Application does not perform properly due to a lack
          of connection or data limitations.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          If you use the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, charges from your
          mobile operator may apply. Roaming charges may also apply if used
          outside your region or country. By using the Application, you accept
          responsibility for all such charges.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if your device runs
          out of battery or experiences other hardware issues that limit access
          to the Application.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          While the Service Provider strives to keep the Application accurate
          and up-to-date, they rely on third-party data sources and therefore
          cannot guarantee complete accuracy or accept responsibility for any
          resulting loss.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          The Application may be updated periodically. You agree to accept all
          updates to continue using the Application. The Service Provider may
          discontinue the Application at any time without notice.
        </p>

        <br />
        <strong>Changes to These Terms</strong>

          These Terms & Conditions may be updated periodically. You are advised
          to review this page regularly for changes. Updates will be posted on

        </p>

        <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-12-04</p>
